<!-- 
    Pure JavaScript Example of a Form that will take its fields and create a simple JSON Object
    from the form field contents and allow you to save the JSON file, and also allows a JSON
    file to be read in from a file and populate a JSON object, which then populates the form
    fields.

    This is an example file and functionality for the Exhibit Object Model Editor/Maintainer that
    is part of the Science Mine Digital Signage Project. The field contents (and structure) will
    need to match that of the EOM JSON object, but those should be relatively easy modifications
    of this files contents.

#Digital Signage for the Science Mine

[![Build
Status](https://travis-ci.org/trevorlbrooks/digital-signage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/trevorlbrooks/digital-signage)

This is a web application using the Emberjs framework to display videos for exhibits. 

Each exhibit will have its own set of videos to display and explain the exhibit.

JSON files created by the EOMEditor will describe the videos and model where the people can
go from each video.

Input will be handled by a mixture of key presses, mouse interaction, and a touch screen.

For more information and specifications of the behavior, see SMDSMockUp.pdf and the files in
the FSM folder.

This project was worked on by the Montana Tech ACM in collaboration with Phil Curtiss and the
Science Mine in Butte, MT.
